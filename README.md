# RevBayes-analyses-Scrophulariaceae
These are the script files to carry out diversification rate analyses in Scrophulariaceae under the EBD (empirical sampling, tribal-genus level) and LSBDS models in RevBayes, described in https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nph.18845. 

`Rev` files contain the scripts; `plot.R` files allow plotting results in R.
